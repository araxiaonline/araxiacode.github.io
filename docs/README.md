# About 
This is a site dedicated to promoting projects built on top of Azerothcore and TrinityCore for World of Warcraft servers.  We believe in promoting open-source projects and have done our best to provide information on this site for active projects our group is developing and providing to the community. 

We are a small group of experienced software developers that have found a new passion for hacking on one of the greatest online games ever launched. 

## Our Server
We do have a small population server and do not advertise and do not intend to try and compete with the group of existing private servers.  We do consistently play content as a small group on Tues and Fridays.  We also run a custom version of NPCBots that enables strong solo play and improved experience with bots we have not open sourced (yet...)  If you are interested in joining our server you can send a direct message to Volek, Dast, ManMadeDrummer, or RageStriker on either the WoW Modding Discord or Azerothcore discord to request and account. 

## Feedback 
You can provide any feedback or report any issues by visiting the project's GitHub and fileing an issue with the project.  You can find the home of all our projects [here](https://github.com/araxiaonline)

## Contributing
If you are interested in contributing to any of our projects, even if it is just provide help on docs, issues, or suggest an idea for a new mod, please feel free to do so.
